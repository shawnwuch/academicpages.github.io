title: "Effect of Perforation Geometry and Orientation on Proppant Placement in Perforation Clusters in a Horizontal Well"
collection: talks
type: "Conference Presentation"
permalink:
excerpt: 'This paper models the transport of proppant through perforations using a coupled computational fluid dynamics with discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach. Reasonable agreements are found between the modeling results and published experimental data. Furthermore, the effectiveness of proppant transport through a perforation is evaluated by the particle transport efficiency (PTE), which is defined as the mass fraction of particles transported through a perforation relative to the total mass of particles in the wellbore upstream of the perforation. The effects of changing casing diameter, proppant size, proppant density, proppant concentration, fluid flow rate, fluid rheology, perforation size, and perforation orientation on PTE are investigated.
