title: "Proppant Distribution Among Multiple Perforation Clusters in a Horizontal Wellbore"
collection: talks
type: "Conference Presentation"

excerpt: 'In this study we present a method for computing the proppant distribution into each cluster in a fracturing stage. By integrating proppant transport into a multi-cluster hydraulic fracturing model and implementing a simple screenout criterion, we show that the proppant distribution in a fracturing stage can be very uneven with a strong bias towards the heel-side clusters even when the initial fluid distribution is uniform among all clusters.
