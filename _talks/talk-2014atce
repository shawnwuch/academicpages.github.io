excerpt: 'In this paper, we use computed tomography (CT) images of real screen coupons to construct 3D replicas of two metal-mesh screen (MMS) types: plain square mesh (PSM) and plain Dutch weave (PDW). An entirely computer-based method of creating 3D screen assemblies is also presented. The virtual screens were compared and validated against the ones generated from the CT images. We also conducted DEM simulations of pre-pack tests through these multi-layer MMS assemblies. The retention efficiency of MMSs for different particle sizes have been calculated for better slurry test modeling. We have shown that the effective size of MMS assemblies can be significantly lower than the nominal rating of the filter layer.
