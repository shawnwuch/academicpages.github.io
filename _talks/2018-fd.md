excerpt: 'A new approach for estimating sand production through gravel packs is presented in this paper. The approach involves two steps: (a) evaluating the pore throat size distribution (PoSD) of a gravel pack and (b) estimating sand production through the gravel pack using an analytical model. Results of the analytical model are compared with sand production data obtained from lab experiments and Monte Carlo simulations.
