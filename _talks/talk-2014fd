title: "Particle Size Distribution Measurement Techniques and Their Relevance or Irrelevance to Sand Control Design"
collection: talks
type: "Conference Presentation"

excerpt: 'This paper reviews the current practices in particle size distribution (PSD) determination and the use (and misuse) of the information obtained from these measurements. A methodology is proposed toward determining what is relevant under gradual-formation-failure conditions for wire-wrap screen, discuss when it should be used and why, and present initial experimental results that support our conclusions.
