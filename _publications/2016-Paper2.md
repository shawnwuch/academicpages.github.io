title: "Coupled CFD-DEM Simulation of Hydrodynamic Bridging at Constrictions"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'This paper presents a coupled CFD-DEM approach to simulate the flow of particulate suspensions in the intermediate concentration regime where solid volume concentration is 1% < φ< 50%. In particular, hy- drodynamic multi-particle bridging during flow through a single constriction in a rectangular channel is studied. It is shown that for neutrally buoyant, monodispersed particulate suspensions, the probability of jamming increases with the particle concentration. There also exists a critical particle concentration (φ∗) for spontaneous bridging, which depends on the ratio of pore size to particle size, the flow velocity, the particle-fluid density contrast, and the flow geometry leading to the constriction.'
