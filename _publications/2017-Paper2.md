title: "A DEM-based approach for evaluating the pore throat size distribution of a filter medium"
collection: publications
permalink: 
excerpt: 'This paper presents a new approach for evaluating the PoSD of a filter medium using a discrete element method (DEM). Good agreement was observed between the simulated and theoretical PoSDs in an ideal sieve and a simple cubic packing case. The study showed that for a monodisperse random close packing (RCP) of spherical grains, the largest pore throat is about 1/4.5 of the grain size, and the smallest pore throat is about 1/6.6 of the grain size. For a polydisperse RCP formed by 20â€“40 mesh grains, the largest pore throat is about 1/5.3 of the effective grain size, and the smallest pore throat is about 1/10 of the effective grain size. The approach can be easily extended to evaluate the PoSD of any type of filter medium, including RCPs with any PSD. The PoSD computed provides essential information for filter layer design and selection.'
